                <h3>Welcome to Harrow Co-op Children's Centre Inc.</h3>

                <p>We are licensed by the Manitoba Early Learning and Childcare Program and offer quality childcare to children ages 3 months - 12yrs.</p>
                <p>Our hours of operation are Monday to Friday from 7:00am - 6:00pm.</p>

We're committed to providing open communication between parents/guardians, teachers in the school and childcare centre. Our policies have been developed in the best interest of the children in our care. It is important that parents share a similar child care philosophy with the centre and that if a problem arises with these policies, parents direct their concerns to the Director.</p>
